Few things to know about the task:
It is set in the south of Turkey.
It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous especially with the Apple Map Pro! : )
You will T/O from runway 18.
It is best flown with an 18m glider preferably motorized, easier to reach the 6000ft max start that way, the thermals are pretty weak.
It is mainly a ridge task with Weather #23 that allows for a challenge when climbing along the ridges.
Sim date and time, July 15th at 1:00pm

Task‚Äôs briefing:
It is a slow and steady ascension to reach WP1,  you‚Äôll have to clear obstructing ridges, fly over high altitude plateaus and prepare for your next ridge in order to successfully reach WP1. There will be some close flying to the ground, people will have to closely monitor their stalling speed at time to avoid crashing.
After you successfully reach WP1, it will be a fast and fun ride to WP2 with no particular difficulties, but you‚Äôll have to decide and hopefully pick the fastest route, there will be many options to get to WP2.
Once you successfully reach WP2, that‚Äôs when the serious planning starts in order to reach WP3 and especially the FINISH line.
The first part of the leg to WP3 will still have some ridges to help you but at some point they will end or you might decide to cross directly over the water, either way it will be all about your STF, so a good management of your Maccready and STF will be crucial to finish the task with enough altitude in the fastest way possible!
Voila!
To the risk of appearing pretentious üòÅ, I think this is a really fun and gorgeous task, which offers an amazing variety of landscapes to fly over and will demand that you fly your glider in a variety of styles to be successful and fast at the same time.
Let me know if you‚Äôre interested and if you agree on it, pick and choose when you want to put it up for the community to fly it, thanks!
